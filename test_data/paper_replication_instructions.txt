- Change the number next to "Components" to 5.
- Click "Done". The clustering window will open.
- Hover over a point to see its ID.
- Click and drag the mouse over an area of the point to make a rectangular selection. Release the mouse to view all records in that range. (Selector colors may vary by operating system).
- Click "Lasso" (at right, under the plots).
- Click and drag the mouse around an area of the plot to make a lasso selection. Release the mouse to view all records in that range.


Figure 9: Record Comparison

Figure 13: Example Naming Conventions
This figure illustrates how the directory tree can be structured to store the data files. This figure is not a snapshot from VEMOS. Data stored in this way can be loaded into VEMOS without using a data description file as follows:
- Click on the Visual Metric Analyzer window (from Figure 4).
- In the top menu, click "File".
- Click "Update loaded data".
- Under "Load Data Record Files", select "Create from Directory". Data type naming conventions can now be set in the "Set Data Types" box.
- Click "Cancel" to return to the Visual Metric Analyzer window.


To close the GUI and maintain all conditions for these instructions:
- Click on the Visual Metric Analyzer window (from Figure 4).
- Click the X button.
- Click on the Visual Record Browser window (from Figure 3).
- Click the X button.
- When prompted to save, click "No".
